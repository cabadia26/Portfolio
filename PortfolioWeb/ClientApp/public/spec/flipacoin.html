Making a decision?

Flipping a coin to decide between two alternatives will help randomly choose. Each choice alternative involved chooses a different side of the coin, either "heads" or "tails," and whichever side
lands facing up is considered the winner.

The main goal is to help make decisions easier and faster by flipping a coin online using the “Heads or Tails” coin flipper.

The player/s should base the alternative decisions to the heads and tails.
(For example, if its heads then "we go out for dinner" and if it's tails "cook dinner home")

The coin flip game works as a heads or tails generator. It allows you to flip a coin online. It’s like flipping an actual penny.

How is the game created?

The player/s will click on the "Click here to flip a coin".
The coin image will change from head side to tail side using a fast timer(appearing to user as a real rotating coin). The coin image will either land at heads or tails.
A point will be added to the side the coin landed on.
The game will go up to three points.
The coin winner will be the choice.
