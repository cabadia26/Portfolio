One of the beginning steps in any student’s educational career is learning the Alphabets.

Letter recognition and identification are important building blocks in literacy.
as these are prerequisites to being able to learn to read. Using abc games that will help students begin to
learn the letters is a great way to begin learning the alphabet.

Finding and matching the letter of the alphabet is another great way to learn the letters.
Given a group of letters, students should be able to match out all of a particular letter.

How is the game created?

On the ABC Memory game, the rows and columns are pre-labeled and don't show (using a front color to block the letter background). 
The player clicks on a cell/letter.
Next, the player clicks on another letter to see if it is a match.
Using a timer, if the letters are a match a message pops up to the player saying "It's a match!"
If the letters are not a match then the letters fold back again so the user can try again.
