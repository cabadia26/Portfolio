/*
I have a chain of bookstores and I need software to manage bookstore inventory and shelving.
Each bookstore should have a name and a unique numeric code for quick reference,
that also allows for us to have two bookstores with the same name.
You don't need to record any location information about the bookstore we have a separate system for that
and will use the bookstore code in the other system.
A book has an author, title, year published, ISBN.
Each store has shelves, each shelf has a numerical sequence number.
The system should be able to record and report which books are on which shelves.
Some shelves have a mix of books, a shelf can have multiple copies of one book.
Books and shelves can have one or more categories. That allows us to keep similar books on a shelf.
